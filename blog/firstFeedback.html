			<h1>First feedback</h1>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>The feedback</h2>
			<p>
				Your motivation seems very well thought out,
				my only recommendation to you would be to see what your goal is with these studies,
				what may keep you extra motivated when the studies become difficult or overwhelming,
				is there a known goal youre aiming for?
			</p>
			<p>
				When looking at your goals after completing the studies,
				it is nice to see you are interested in becoming a software engineer.
				Besides working on code, what else do you enjoy in being a software engineer?
				Why does it appeal to you more than being a programmer?
				Would you enjoy working in a team? I would recommend you to try and research more about software
				engineering but maybe other positions as well just to understand your options, what would you like to do
				in your day to day?
				How would you like your role to look like?
				Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses taught.
				I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can
				get more information about different professions in the ICT field.
			</p>
			<p>
				Referring to your SWOT analysis, its good to see you acknowledge already some of your strengths and
				weaknesses.
				If you do not find joy in what youre doing?
				Will you invest less time in it, what will help you get through it?
				How will you make it into an opportunity.
				Same with your weakness of being unproductive because of focusing on the wrong things, how will you
				handle this, can you prepare yourself for the upcoming studies in some way or what will help you during
				the studies?
				Can it be good sometimes as well or just negative?
			</p>

			<h2>My thoughts about the feedback</h2>
			<p>
				My goal with the study is to learn how computers work, to learn how to become good at programming but also to create something that is accessible for many users. My motivation doesn't have to rely on a set goal as I often put my goals to low. Once I finish them I lose what kept me going. I base my motivation on the joy of the subject itself which is programming and doing something with computers. It is what I do in my free time, and it is what I like to do in the future of my career. That is all I need to stay motivated, then my goal can be seen as having a career I enjoy doing. Then I only have to find out what my career is going to be. I know that I enjoy linux, open source, accessibility, programming, reverse engineering, music, the web, gaming and much more. Those could all factor in what I want to do in my future.
