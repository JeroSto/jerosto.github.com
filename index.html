			<h1>Why ICT?</h1>

			<h2>Welcome to Jeroen Stout's website</h2>

			<h3>Why did I choose ict?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Digital is what I love</li>
				<li>I want to help on software projects</li>
				<li>I love open source</li>
				<li>I like linux</li>
				<li>ICT connects all my interests together</li>
				<li>I am a nerd</li>

			<h3>The beginning</h3>
			<p>When I was little I loved video games, but it was mainly my dream to play them online. Then when I was allowed to I didn't only learn about games. I also learned about the world wide web with a wide array of content to explore. I didn't understand the inspect element and I didn't know I had the possibility to do it myself. But it facinated me. When I became older I mostly played retro video games we had and fixed them for my current computer using hex editors. I didn't know, but this was my first introduction  to coding.</p>

			<h3>What came inbetween</h3>
			<p>In high school I was mainly distracted with my tests. The computer I used back before my high school started was thrown out. So I only had old laptops that my family didn't use, the current one I have is my brothers old laptop. Because they were old laptops and desktop environments moved on, I was done listening to the loud fans running and my laptop screaming just to run windows 7 with it's base applications. After searching for solutions I found the magic of linux which could fix my problem. I started using ubuntu as my first operating system as this seemed like the best beginner option. After some time I kept distro hopping which made me more experienced with different distributions, this also made me understand differences that seem minor at first, but are quite impactful after a while. Due to the operating system I used I began to find the value in privacy and freedom. This in turn made my love for linux, open source and just computers in general bigger. I never knew what I wanted to do for my study, but I wouldn't know any other place then ICT.</p>

			<h3>Now I am here!</h3>
			<p>I finished my high school and now started with my study of ICT at HZ University of Applied sciences. I couldn't be happier with the choice that I made. I already met great people and haven't ever felt in place as much as I do here. The start was rough, I was using opensuse which challenged my knowledge of apache and the operating system itself. It didn't work out which made me change to windows. Then as a kind arrival gift, windows wrote inside my <abbr title="Master Boot Record">MBR</abbr> which corrupted the <abbr title="GNU GRand Unified Bootloader">GRUB</abbr>. Next on the list is Debian for this laptop.</p>
