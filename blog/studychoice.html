			<h1>Study choice activities</h1>
			<p>I have spend years on years looking for what I really want to
				do. Nothing felt quite right as I wasn't really introduced to
				programming and didn't really have a solid hobby or interest
				that would be right to pursue as a career choice. I went from
				the mavo to havo, and in my time at the havo I made this...</p>

			<h1>Motivate your study choice</h1>
			<p>I am very interested in all that has to do with computers. I like open source programs. I also like gaming a lot. I would like to
				learn to programs at a study and for work, as for now I don't have time to fully invest myself into programming due to school. I
				love to think of what problems may be solved via programming, as well as fun ideas for entertainment and games.
				The study program also peaked my interest because it addresses a lot of topics in programming I enjoy and would like to learn
				about and already have learned about. Computer science, game development, software development, business value creation
				and data science are all things I am encouraged to learn about.
				Programming always seems to be about one thing to others, which is writing the code itself. But when you look around you it

			<h1>After completing the study</h1>
			<p>I would love to be a software engineer after I graduate. I am not particularly interested in one single position and would love to
				work to help develop certain software for a developer or to be able to work on a game. I know that I would like to feel valued as
				an employee and would want to enjoy my place at the company. But I wouldn't know one specific position in the company. I
				know I want to be a software engineer because I do know that I want to be working on code and that I want to be able to express
				my creative thinking in the way I built something. I want to be able to make a product that I and the one I am working for can
				be happy with, there is nothing like the feeling of a code that runs like you want it to.
				I expect to learn how I can program but also how I can translate the wishes of someone else into code. I also expect to learn a
				new variety and array of things that have to do with computers and programming that I wouldn't have found out on my own.</p>
