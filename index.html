				<h2>Welcome to Jeroen Stout's website</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Why did I choose ict?</h3>
				<ul id="homeintrounordered">
					<li>Digital is what I love</li>
					<li>I want to help on software projects</li>
					<li>I love open source</li>
					<li>I like linux</li>
					<li>ICT connects all my interests together</li>
					<li>I am a nerd</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

				<h3>The beginning</h3>
				<p>When I was little I loved video games, but it was mainly my dream to play them online. Then when I
					was
					allowed to I didn't only learn about games. I also learned about the world wide web with a wide
					array of
					content to explore. I didn't understand the inspect element and I didn't know I had the possibility
					to
					do it myself. But it facinated me. When I became older I mostly played retro video games we had and
					fixed them for my current computer using hex editors. I didn't know, but this was my first
					introduction
					to coding.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>What came inbetween</h3>
				<p>In high school I was mainly distracted with my tests. The computer I used back before my high school
					started was thrown out. So I only had old laptops that my family didn't use, the current one I have
					is
					my brothers old laptop. Because they were old laptops and desktop environments moved on, I was done
					listening to the loud fans running and my laptop screaming just to run windows 7 with it's base
					applications. After searching for solutions I found the magic of linux which could fix my problem. I
					started using ubuntu as my first operating system as this seemed like the best beginner option.
					After
					some time I kept distro hopping which made me more experienced with different distributions, this
					also
					made me understand differences that seem minor at first, but are quite impactful after a while. Due
					to
					the operating system I used I began to find the value in privacy and freedom. This in turn made my
					love
					for linux, open source and just computers in general bigger. I never knew what I wanted to do for my
					study, but I wouldn't know any other place then <abbr title="Information and Communication Technologies">ICT</abbr>. Thus I was looking around in the <abbr title="Information and Communication Technologies">ICT</abbr> studies and landed on <abbr title="Information and Communication Technologies">ICT</abbr> at Avans, <abbr title="Hogeschool Zeeland">HZ</abbr> or game development at <abbr title="Breda University of Applied Sciences">BUAS</abbr>. Avans was just way to big and unpersonal for me, it was badly orgized as well, so that one isn't school I want to end up in. I found out that the study at <abbr title="Breda University of Applied Sciences">BUAS</abbr> would make me and up at some triple A studio and this is not a place I want to work, unless I hate myself. I want to have a life so it wouldn't be a study that I would want to follow. It would've had more of a chance if the projects to get into the school weren't planned just before my exams.</p>

				<h3>Now I am here!</h3>
				<p>I finished my high school and now started with my study of ICT at HZ University of Applied sciences.
					I
					couldn't be happier with the choice that I made. I already met great people and haven't ever felt in
					place as much as I do here. The start was rough, I was using opensuse which challenged my knowledge
					of
					apache and the operating system itself. It didn't work out which made me change to windows. Then as
					a
					kind arrival gift, windows wrote inside my <abbr title="Master Boot Record">MBR</abbr> which
					corrupted
					the <abbr title="GNU GRand Unified Bootloader">GRUB</abbr>. Now I changed to mx Linux which is a derivitive of Debian. Debian itself is to special for me and MX makes linux work.
